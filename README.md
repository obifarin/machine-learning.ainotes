# Introduction to Machine Learning (In Progress)

These are my notes on machine learning published on http://bifarinthefifth.com/machine-learning-ai/ <br>

***[Take this notes as a token from a biologist/biochemist learning about machine learning.]*** <br>

As the readers familiar with Machine Learning will know, there are three pillars to understanding the subject: 
1) Mathematics (Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, etc.) 
2) Computer programming, and 
3) Statistics.

And, if it helps, you can always think of machine learning as advanced – or say modern – statistics for computer scientists.

My intention is to start from the barest scratch. To start from the mathematics pre-requisites, then I will cross over very gently into statistics, I will most likely skip any elaborate introductory programming tutorials, and then we will delve into various ML algorithms – and then begin to unpack them. 

When I am coding, expect to see me work with Jupyter notebook. Our programming language will be python, for data processing and handling, you will see me use pandas like crazy.  For data visualization, I will work with matplotlib, seaborn (also based on matplotlib), and maybe plotly. I will use numpy and scipy for parametric and non-parametric statistics. Finally, for machine learning, I will use scikit-learn an awful lot.
