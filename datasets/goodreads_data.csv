I read this one for the first time few years ago, and picked it up again. The book - when read with the apt mindset, receptive mind - works like a 'medisin': extremely therapeutic. It is bathed in common sense (heavily), psychology (mildly), christian philosophy (heavily) and stoicism (somewhat heavily). We will always live with worry and anxiety, there is no escape, it comes with the baggage; perhaps, then, it's a good idea to manage it, so that one could do that which one should do relatively calmly and optimally. That sounds like a good plan to me. So, happy reading! ",2

Brilliant woman! I searched for the book for years, but recently got my hands on it. Here, she argued for a parity of status between Orunmila and Socrates, whom she stated are two patron saints of classical philosophy. She engaged in a very deep, critical comparative analysis of African and Western philosophy. And, as a side note: one thing I liked about her (the book) is that she didn't shy away from throwing trenchant jabs at philosophers who ignorantly downgraded, or questioned the existence of a bonafide African Philosophy. Her arguments, for me, are quite convincing. As such, if anyone one needs convincing that we (Africans) had thrown away the baby with the bath water. Buy this book (good luck getting it) and read carefully.",1

I will summarize. Because we only get to live life once, then life has to be meaningless. And by ascribing meaning to life we become 'weighty', but it's only a matter of time before we become awakened to our 'authenticity' (a state of Being where you discover that life is meaningless). But the whole argument is disturbingly irrational: ""just because we only get to live life once"" then life has to be meaningless? <br/>That being said, the book is very deep.

I enjoyed it because of it's bluntness, it's truths. Anyone who had read a few Cal Newport's book would enjoy it. Needless to say Bennett's book is one of the prominent 'primary literatures' in most Newport's productivity books and essays, especially Deep Work. In this book Bennett addresses the 'salarymen' to seize their leisure time to drastically improve themselves. And he does a good job of exposing a great deal of free time that usually go untapped - early mornings, travel time to and from work, evenings, and weekends. I have attempted most of the 'tricks' in this book and it works too well but not without developing a very strong self discipline. He says, ""which of us lives on twenty-four hours a day?

After spending twenty or so years in several Nigeria educational institutions, I had no idea that I had no idea of the deep schism at Nigeria's birth, especially the big one manifested in the Biafra war. And so you know, I am NOT the type that skips classes or fails to write notes. <br/><br/>In this book, Chinua Achebe narrated his own personalized history of the Biafra war starting with his childhood and initial education under the British system, and the he transitioned to the gory periods after the Nigerian independence. First, the January 15 1966 coup championed by two soldiers. This lead to the death of several people from the Northern extraction of the country including the prime minister of Nigeria, Tafawa Balewa. In certain quarters, especially in the North, the coup was believed to be an Igbo coup, because it was lead by soldiers of the Eastern extraction of the country. <br/><br/>And of course you begin to have this back and forth thing, starting with the 1966 counter-coup (July rematch) where, the north retaliated; in between you have the 1966 anti-Igbo pogrom. All laying a deadly foundation for the Biafra war which ended in unfathomable massacres with millions of Biafrans dead of starvation. And of course the 'war' did not end after the war. <br/><br/>As I read through the book, it made perfect sense while the country is still confused up until today, and at some point, I asked the obvious question: ""If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?”",1

In the middle of  all of these, some weird ultra-conservative Catholic sect got caught up in Edmond's murder.  <br/><br/>Apart from the exhausted nature of this novel's plot, it's so tiring to continue to see how shallow ideas about the origin of the universe are continued to be promoted. How on earth does a law of anything abhors a creative force? I am surprised I was able to finish the book, and I will blame that on the extremely popular, sunk cost effect. ",1

And the moment you see how it works you cannot but see how it fails. <br/><br/>Feudalism was the thing before capitalism. Where the 'king' owns the land, and gives to his subjects as politics dictates. These aristocrats own serfs and make them work on their lands, and there it goes: you get production of products (by the serf), followed by distribution (lords consume their bits and sell the rest), and then we can talk credits and debits. <br/><br/>However, when the merchants were becoming massively rich from global trades, local landowners in England and Scotland decided to follow suit. And what happened is the commodification of land and labor which lead to the great reversal - distribution now precedes production. This is the birth of capitalist societies and it created humongous wealth and productivity.<br/><br/>But, it came with a price: misery and poverty for the majority, with a tiny proportion of the population owning almost all the wealth. Sounds familiar? And not only that, the moment profit becomes the main goal, commodification of almost anything becomes attractive, even if it leads to the destruction of the planet. Sounds familiar? And of course the system crashes every now and then because of the black magic of bankers, irresponsibilities of politicians, and the funny behavior of money and human labor.<br/><br/>Not much is said about clearing these debris, but I have to say: Yanis's little book is one of the most accessible books I have read about the economy.",1

The author, his son Chris, and some friends rode across the West (the United States) on their motorcycles. In the course of the journey, the author gave series of 'lectures' he called Chautauquas majorly on epistemology and philosophy of science. He teaches Quality, which could be taken literally at the most practical level. <br/><br/>Going deeper, he talks a lot about the Metaphysics of Quality (MoQ).<br/><br/>Here I will focus of MoQ.<br/><br/>Empiricism is the theory that all knowledge comes from sense-experience, and right off the bat, you see that empiricism accommodates perfectly metaphysical features of the world: arts, morality, religion, and all of those things. <br/><br/>However, these metaphysical features are claimed by scientism to be unreal. This exclusion on the basis of un-realness springs from an assumption, a yuggeeee (metaphysical) assumption, which itself is not verifiable (via science). <br/><br/>Prisig went beyond this object-subject 'obsession' of science to a whole different level. He claims that all things that exists are values or quality (note that 'objects' and 'subjects' themselves are as a result of quality), and they can be unpacked into two categories: 1) Dynamic Quality 2) Static quality. <br/><br/>Dynamic Quality (with a capital letter Q) can't be defined aptly in words, as it's existence is perceived before any intellectual assembly is possible. While static quality refer to all concepts that can be captured empirically. The implication of this run deep: MoQ becomes more empirical than science...<br/><br/>“What is good, Phaedrus, and what is not good – need we ask anyone to tell us these things?” <br/><br/>This is one of the greatest philosophical fiction I have read so far.",1

Aare Kurunmi, the protagonist, occupies the position of war-general-cum-defense-ministerof the disintegrating Oyo empire of the West Africa. The author (knowingly or unknowingly) explores the skin-in-the-game philosophy, where leaders lead with their skin in the game. In shorts when a leader cooks, they eat from their own cooking very quickly. The way things are supposed to be, not the baloney set-up we have in today’s world    <br/><br/>Aare Kurunmi's skin-in-the-gamephilosophy is particularly penetrating - he went to war with his 5 sons! Fighting at the forefront, where the battle boils of the greatest heat. And, well, the sad part: they all died. A leader should lead right in front, with all his skin in the game.

I will say some sort of logo-therapy and Buddhism too. Anyways, for all of -isms, Lauren, the protagonist and earthseed discoverer, says [her] ""God is Change"". Here is one of the verses in the 'scripture', so to speak “All that you touch you change. All that you change changes you. The only lasting truth is change.
